One of the biggest challenges we face currently is a complete lack of documentation for our existing
infrastructure. We need people to follow up on development efforts, document maintenance tasks, document
APIs, and collate documentation into a centralized location.

There is no expected standard or specification to adhere to, however any instructions that are written should
be written in such a way that they are step-by-step, and fairly idiot proof.

## Requirements
* Create all necessary README and INSTALL files
* Ensure that appropriate licenses are packaged with each code base.
* Document all maintenance tasks, step-by-step, for idiots.
* Document all externally accessible APIs according to the specifications in the [Project Parameters](/project_parameters) page.
* Assist project leads in the creation of diagrams.
