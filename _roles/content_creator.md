Developers should not be writing content. Great at making systems work, not always great at understanding
what should be presented to the end users. Content creators will work with developers and project leads to
understand what needs to be written. This can include help files, articles, graphics, tutorials, videos,
diagrams, illustrations.

Content managers will work to distribute this content to the appropriate projects in whatever the approved
and appropriate manner would be. This may also involve some user management depending on the application,
but instructions and knowledge base will be specific to the project.

## Requirements
* Write content as needed for each application.
* Review applications and determine what content is needed
* Work with project leads and project managers to create necessary content for projects.
* Proofread content that has already been created.
* Distribute content to applications as necessary.
