Somehow we have to herd all of these cats. We'll need some serious project analysis, ticket writing
and task management.  Help develop development, deployment, and quality control workflows. Keep the
developers moving forward and coordinated, make sure that everyone has the resources that they need
to continue in their tasks. Ensure that the workflows are being followed.

## Requirements

* Create and manage tickets and tasking for development team.
* Ensure that development, deployment, and quality control workflows are being respected.
* Cat herding
