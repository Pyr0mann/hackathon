Historically, design, user experience, and user interaction have not been a priority for Unallocated Space.
We need help with making things pretty, driving user adoption rates for new software, and encouraging
conversation between Unallocated and our end users.

## Responsibilities
* Generate mockups and wireframes for end-user facing applications.
* Review existing UI/UX. Make recommendations with justifications for improvements.
* Respect the scope of existing applications.
* MAKE PRETTY THINGS!!!
