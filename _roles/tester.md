Developers aren't bullet proof. We'll need somebody to handle testing. Put these applications through
their paces and break things!!! Review and understand the application requirements, and verify that
the applications are functioning as required.

Be prepared to write tickets and be capable of articulating bugs and issues. Work with project managers
and developers to verify application functionality.

## Requirements
* Understand project requirements.
* Test each ticket and verify functionality against requirements.
* Create tickets and communicate with project managers in order to generate tickets for failed tests.
* Use of the words "not" and "working" in conjunction will result in public flogging. Please articulate
failures thoroughly.
