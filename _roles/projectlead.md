### A $50/mo Membership or better is required to be a project lead.

A Project Lead will be considered the "owner" of the project. This role will make high level decisions and
be the primary authority on the development track for each project. This role will take on an extra level
of responsibility in terms of project setup, and preparations for the hackathon.

Since we will be working on core services applications that directly affect the daily operations of
Unallocated Space, we are expecting this role to be filled by a $50/mo Member or better. We require someone
who has a tangible investment in the future of Unallocated Space.

This is a more intensive role than the others and will require more time in order to prepare for this
event (it shouldn't be too bad, I'm not expecting this to become a time-suck).

A project lead may only lead one project at a time.

## Responsibilities
* Building the team required for the project
* Facilitate the project infrastructure and communications
* Primary point of contact for all project specific inquiries.
* Delegation of roles and tasking.
* Ensure that all team members are empowered to perform the necessary work on the day of the hackathon.
* Merge and integrate code as necessary.
* Set up and manage all necessary testing accounts. i.e. for a twitter integration, a test twitter account should be set up and credentials distributed to the team.
* Understand project requirements and translate them as appropriate to PMs and developers.

## Deadlines
* All requests for project leadership must be made before Oct 18. Projects that remain unclaimed at this point
will be removed from the list.
