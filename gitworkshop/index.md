title: Git Workshop
---

Part of the mission of this hackathon is to make all of the core services of Unallocated Space
open source and available to the public. We have chosen [GitHub](https://github.com) as the
distribution platform of choice. As such, it is essential that as a community, we have an
understanding of Git, its workflows, and its power as a central repository and distribution
platform.

To this end, before the hackathon, we will be hosting a thorough Github workshop to cover
all components required for the fulfillment of this objective.

This will be a free event and all are welcome. Participation in the hackathon is not required,
though it is greatly encouraged.

#### Introduction to Git and Github
We'll discover what Git is, its relationship to Github, and high level Git operation. We'll
talk about situations where Git is and is not useful, and its relationship to other version
control systems. Also, there will be some discussion regarding the purpose of version control
and the application of continuous integration as a part of the development lifecycle.  We'll
talk about Github and its relationship to the mission of Unallocated Space.

#### The Basics
There's a lot to learn with Git, so we'll start at the bottom. We'll learn about repositories,
and branches, and staging and commits. We'll talk a little bit about how this can be used even
when not collaborating with other developers.

We'll learn about how to work with remote repositories, forking, pushing, pulling and keeping your
code base up to date with other concurrent work. We'll also talk about how to use your remote
repositories to protect your code base.

#### A Little More Complicated
We'll discuss when to create new branches, how to create them, and how to merge them back in. We'll
discover the value of cherry-picking, rebasing, patching and other branch management techniques
and how to use these when things get inevitably get messed up.

We'll also talk about what pull requests are and how to make them. We'll talk about the code review
process and how to merge code submitted by other people into your repository.

We'll also talk about the relationship between Git's index, the code, and the head.

#### The Bigger Picture
As we build up the skillset, we will want to start applying them to larger scale projects with
multiple developers. We'll talk about tagging and versioning. We'll not only look at the various
git workflows, but also learn how to structure a development workflow around them that is project
appropriate and gets your team into a rhythm. We'll finish this thing up with some Release Mastery
and get you ready to push out into the world.
