Create a web and scripting interface for controlling a traffic light.

Things to work on during the Hackathon:

 * Setup basic hardware control. Ensure we can turn lights on an off.
 * Layout a basic webpage to engage controls and see light status.
 * Authentication mechanism for webpage with a way to change the password.
 * Create a way to store light timing and patterns.
 * If there is time, create a way to save and recall the patterns.
