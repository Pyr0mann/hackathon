This is a LED sign that sits in the area above the restrooms in the hackerspace that is highly visible. Currently, the sign can only be updated via IRC using the IRC bot and the code to do so is part of the IRC bot.

The primary goal is to produce a service with a documented API for updating the sign. This API can be used by the IRC bot and by any other services running in the hackerspace.

During the hackathon, the goals for this project are:
 * Design, define, and document a RESTful API for the sign service
 * Write code to implement the API
